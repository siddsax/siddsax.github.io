Rankings have always been a matter of significant discussions and debates. They have become a reference point for students while choosing an institute for their higher studies, but just a prima facie view of these rankings can be tremendously misleading. With a large amount of data available online, making sense out of it is far from an easy task, even more so for a prospective student.

To delve deeper into the ranking methodologies, two rankings: the Quadrelli Simmons or QS Rankings and the Indian Government initiative, the NIRF rankings were analyzed by Vox, and the unique insights derived. The first part of it, derived from the QS rankings is presented here.

QS Ranking system consists of various rankings, the most prominent ones of which are the  World University Rankings, Graduate Employability Rankings, University Rankings by Region and World University Rankings by Faculty.

First look at the World University Rankings, and the mere numbers paint a bleak picture. None of the IITs come in the top 100 or even the top 150. IITD, the best of the IITs comes in at 185 with a score of 48.6/100 whereas IITK ranks at 302 scoring just 36.7/100.

The most notable thing is the score of IITs in the faculty-student Ratio and International students and faculty. 

<img style="float: left;width:450px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=1293867544&format=image">
<img style="float: right;width:490px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=773598164&format=image">

Comparing IITs with National University of Singapore (NUS), the top Asian University it can be seen that the ratio of international students and faculty for NUS is much higher than all the IITs, with more than half of the NUS faculty being from abroad. These parameters have separate weight age of 5% each in world rankings.

Similarly, IITs have less than half the Faculty-Student ratio as that of NUS. This parameter has 10% weight-age in the world rankings.

<img style="float: right;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=516979939&format=image">

Another point to note is that the quality of papers of IITD is much better than any other IIT with 93.2/100 in CPP, whereas IITK performs moderately at 64.2. The score of IITB was much lower at 48.5, more on this later.

In the Asian Rankings, a somewhat different picture is seen. IITB tops all the other IITs, coming in at 35, scoring 76 points out of 100, whereas IITK ranks 48 scoring 68.1 points.  

<img align="middle" style="float: center;width:600px;margin-left:150px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=1752964790&format=image">
The score of NUS is 100 in all parameters except Papers per faculty 

The most surprising thing is that IITB tops this ranking even when IITD tops the world university rankings with quite a large margin because these rankings have a different weight ages than the world rankings.

Another thing evident from the above graph is that in addition to the number of papers published, the quality of papers is also critical. NUS lags way behind regarding the number of papers (60.1/100) in contrast to IITs, which average 94.5 between them but NUS has 100/100 regarding Citation per Paper, whereas IITs do poorly on this parameter.

Here we also see a queer thing in the rankings, IITK ranks below IITB regarding citations per papers whereas the contrary was right in the World Rankings.

IITs have a favorable employer reputation which is echoed by the fact that IITians occupy several high posts worldwide in both industry and academia.

IITs are engineering institutes for a fact with much lower emphasis on arts and medicine, and this is a major cause for IITs suffering regarding ranks. This means that the reality is not as bad as it might seem regarding rankings. All top 5 IITs rank under 150 in core engineering topics, with most departments ranking in the top 100. This can be seen when we take a more subject wise perspective.  

<img style="float: right;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=466790325&format=image">

As it can be seen above, IITK does not fare too well when compared to the IITs in most subjects. Although one standout is Mathematics, lagging behind only IITB regarding the overall score.

<img style="float: left;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=1224372995&format=image">

The better quality of papers was the deciding factor with IITK bagging the highest score in H Index Citations and the second best in Citations Per Paper from amongst the IITs. Now at the other end of the spectrum, Civil Engineering department lags behind the other IITs with the lowest score in Citations per paper as well as H-Index citations.

<img style="float: right;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=669104485&format=image">

Having a look at the renowned and pioneering CSE Department of IITK, we see a similar story as in Civil Engineering Department. It is tied on the overall score with IITKgp at 4th position.

<img style="float: left;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=1062415890&format=image">

Arguably the best performing field for Indian institutes, Electrical Engineering department of all the top 5 IITs and the IISc ranked in the top 100. EE department of IITK has a competitive score in the category of Employer Reputation and H-Index Citations, which wasn’t the case in other disciplines, but is again ranked lower than other IITs due to the poor score in Citations Per Paper which is also the least of all Indian institutes.

<img style="float: right;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=1170457489&format=image">

IITK’s standing can be summarised by the following two graphs; they highlight the fact that we lack regarding the quality of papers in almost all the subjects except for Department of Maths and Chemistry, which translates into a better rank for these departments.      

<img style="float: right;width:500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mAjY0z3eX0EpW3vl0RsnvPGEgFn3UpEQWbfdlL5b39s/pubchart?oid=1523885458&format=image">

The above problem is also evident in the faculty rankings. The faculty rankings of 2015 revolve
<img style="float: right;width:600px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBjxe4HraKBTJCozZ9dSIFVWePrwn-8w9GZ1O8QWgpQ/pubchart?oid=1471746336&format=image">

chiefly around the academic reputation of the faculty members, their standing in the eyes of the employers and the quantitative estimation of the quality of their research papers, which is further split into two: Citations per Paper and H-Index Citations.

As is evident from the above chart, the main reason for IITK’s poor score, vis-a-vis the other IITs, is the Employer Reputation and the H-Index Citation. The sole reason IITB pulls ahead of IITD is also the-Index Citation, with a whopping 9.1 point difference.

On an aside, we also looked at subjects like economics and arts, but IITs were nowhere in sight, other than IITB that surprisingly stood in top 100 in arts and designs. Similarly, IITs do very poorly in biological fields, with IITB and IITD being the only ranked IITs coming in the range of 300-400

The subject wise rankings data show that IITs suffer a lot regarding world ranks due to lower scores in subjects like business, management, art, and design. This leads to the most striking revelation of all: the average scores (as calculated using all UG courses except BSBE which comes under Biological Sciences in QS and Economics ) and those of the world rankings have a wide gap in between them as shown below.

What is even more surprising is that the same is not true for all universities, Consider the scores in Academic Reputation for University of Science and Technology (China), ranked at 104 in QS World Ranking. It is 64.1 on average on the subjects offered by it and 63.1 in the World Rankings. Similar is true for the other IITs and many institutes, which dampens the credibility of the World Rankings.

The article shall be continued via its second part, focusing on the NIRF rankings.

All analysis done here is by the data provided by the QS. We are only considering the five oldest IITs, namely IIT Kharagpur (IITKgp), IIT Madras (IITM), IIT Kanpur (IITK), IIT Bombay (IITB) and IIT Delhi (IITD)
