Evolution. Evolution is the fight to survival, it is the fight to supremacy and it arises from the most basic of rules, Change. Over the long history of this planet which might be well a futile, tiny fraction of the universe, species have come, conquered and gone in the dust. But one of them, luckily for us, has lived long enough and dominated far beyond one can even conceive. Thus a question naturally arises, what’s next?

It has been some time and preposterous amount of movies since we have been contemplating to find that elusive friend or enemy and have called it A.I. But is this how evolution works? I have been pondering over this for some time and this debate within me has been initiated by two pieces of art, that show a contrasting but equally realistic path to that sentient being that shall dominate the planet beyond ours. One of them is Ghost in a Shell (1995), it is an anime movie which shows a future where the line between machine and human is ever so thin, it begins with the creation of Motoko Kusanagi, the first of it's kind that has a human brain attached to a complete robotic body. On the other hand is the new HBO juggernaut Westworld, which focuses on the questions of what is consciousness and is there free will. As Dr Ford ( Sir Anthony Hopkins ) puts it in one of his dialogues “We've managed to slip evolution's leash now, haven't we? We can cure any disease, keep even the weakest of us alive, and, you know, one fine day, Perhaps we shall even resurrect the dead, call forth lazarus from his cave. Do you know what that means? It means that we're done.”

These are two of the most contrasting theories about how we shall evolve from this point and point us to be very near to it. Most of the people have given up and are waiting for the day when our resurrection happens ( until or unless a guy with shiny hair decides to blow up a nuke on someone pinching him or murder the successes of Environmentalists) and this belief has been strengthen by not only the recent research but pop culture, but have we ever even considered the former theory? The subtle one, the one with less punches and twists. 

Artificial Enhancements might still not be here today but several revelations have taken a corresponding biological organs’ role without even us noticing. We already have artificial eyes, ears and limbs. Some like pacemakers are something that seems normalcy these days but they too replace a natural organ, similarly do dialysis machines. Whereas compared to what A.I. has done is being a tool. A tool that gives us the content relevant to us, recognises friends in our pictures or something as mundane as snapchat. The closest it has come to directly replacing a human is the autonomous cars which is driving this conversation forward. A.I. today and for some time will be a facilitator than an orchestrator. 

To be continued....
