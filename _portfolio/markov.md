details: I gave this talk in the fall of 2016 on the broad topic of Markov Chain and Hidden Markov Models for Speech Recognition. The outline of the talk was to familiarize the audience with concept of Hidden Markov Models and then illustrate how it is applied on the problem of Speech Recognition, the problems associated with it and the solution including the Expectation-Minimization algorithm used for inference.
