intro: Aalto is a Redwood, California based software company that provides account aggregation services. I interned at the Bangalore center in the Data Science team mentored by Dr. Om Deshmukh, Director Data Science in summers of 2017. I worked in the Transaction Data Enrichment (TDE) project which was the firm's most important project at that time. The project deals with finding inferences from data like employer ID, merchant names, transaction type, etc.

problem: The project deals with overcoming the problem of big data, to find a better representation of 60 Billion transactions so that they can be fed to another machine learning model for training technically called Instance Selection. I developed a special online clustering model that can be fed a large number of data points and it produces varied clusters on the basis of the semantics of the descriptions.

results: The model that I produced was by far much more scalable than any of the existing models with efficient memory and computation usage using spark framework and HDFS data system. It produced excellent clusters that had unique identity words. Further evaluations are going on to find the improvement in the generalization of other models due to it and the data compression factor.
