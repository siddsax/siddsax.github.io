intro: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle or AUV-IITK is one of the major robotics project, mentored by Prof. KS Venkatesh and Prof. Sachin Y Shinde. The aim of this project is to create a fully an underwater vehicle that can perform a set of tasks underwater without any human control. I was the Computer Vision subdivision head for the period of January 2016 to December 2016

problem: Applied Pose Detection via SIFT and SURF Descriptors for an L-shaped gate, identifying the angle made by it. Applied Convolutional Neural Networks for pattern detection via Tensorflow. Used OpenCV library along with ROS framework to implement various object detection algorithms.

results: We came in as 2nd runner ups in our debut attempt at the national level competition NIOT-SAVe, December 2016 where teams from other IITs and colleges took part, with a much superior software built upon ROS framework. The team is now targeting the NIOT-SAVe 2017 and ROBOSUB, San Diego 2018.
