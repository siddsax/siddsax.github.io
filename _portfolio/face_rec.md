intro: This project was done under the Association of Computing Activites at IITK and part of my first exposure to Machine Learning. I had been doing computer vision without ML in the past via AUV but this project introduced me to the know-hows. There were two parts of the project, handwriting recognition, and sentimental analysis, getting to know both images and text.

problem_1: The sentimental analysis part focused on detecting if an IMDB review is positive or negative. I used a naive Bayes classifier modeled along the tracks of a spam classifier to test whether the review is a positive one or negative. I used tokenization using the NLTK library to reduce the complexity as well.

problem_2: I did Handwriting recognition on the MNIST dataset, employing a simple feedforward single layer neural network. I experimented with quadratic, cross entropy and softmax loss function hence improving the accuracy to more than 96%. Besides also going into the theory of backpropagation as well as Universal Approximation Theorem.
